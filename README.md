**winc** is a simple include, but it will make your server different from others. Basically, it puts a warning/message on the screen in the form of a textdraw, it can be a good substitute for the good old SendClientMessage. To use it is simple.

`#include <winc>`

and that's it, you can already use it.

`native: CreateWarning(playerid, const callback[], title[], params[], timer = 80)`
