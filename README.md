**winc** is a simple include, but it will make your server different from others. Basically, it puts a warning/message on the screen in the form of a textdraw, it can be a good substitute for the good old SendClientMessage. To use it is simple.

<sub>#include <winc></sub>

and that's it, you can already use it.
